# converttomp4
Shell script to convert multiple video files at once using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

Copies the videos (*.VOB and *.MOD extensions) from the folders in the specified footage directory, converts them and deletes the working copy afterwards.
This results in a mirrored version of the original file tree containing the converted mp4 videos.
